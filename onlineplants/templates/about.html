                     <p>Natural landscapes meet manâ€™s basic requirements of water, air and soil that are useful for human survival. These are also necessary for the survival of other living creatures that need sun, air, light, water and land to survive.

But humans have evolved their own systems for survival with systems like terraced farming, fruit farming, partially-settled agriculture, livestock farming, tourism, collection of wild fruits, dependence on forest products, fishing, and similar other livelihood options. </p>

                     <h3>  plants </h3>
                     <p>Plants are living organisms that play an important role in our lives. They belong to the Plantae kingdom as per science. The study of plants and their characteristics is known as Botany. Plants and trees are very important in our lives. Directly or indirectly, plants are connected with our lives, and we both are interdependent on each other. Plants provide us with various fruits, vegetables, oxygen, etc. We help them with carbon dioxide. Plants help in maintaining the ecosystem. Growing a plant is not so easy. It needs a lot of care for a plant to grow into a huge tree or a fully grown plant.</p>

                     <h3> acessories</h3>
                     <p>Forest gardening, a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest form of gardening.[2] Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions. In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually foreign species were also selected and incorporated into the gardens.[3]</p>
